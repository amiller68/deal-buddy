Current summary: 20 West 37th Street is a mixed-use office building located in Midtown Manhattan, strategically positioned between 5th and 6th Avenues near major transportation hubs including Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, and Penn Station. The 12-story property spans 82,350 rentable square feet, featuring basement, ground, and mezzanine level retail space (currently vacant), plus office space with four existing single-floor tenants. The building features an assumable loan maturing January 10, 2027, with an approximately 4.7% interest rate. Listed at $32,500,000, this value-add asset offers flexible floor plans that can be easily divided to accommodate various tenant needs. The property's immediate vacancies present opportunities for renovation and capital improvements, making it attractive for both investors seeking an asset below replacement cost with favorable financing, and potential users interested in owner-occupancy in a flagship New York City location. The building's annual real estate taxes (2022/23) are $672,825.

The property features an assumable loan originated on 12/8/16 with an outstanding principal of $27,500,000, maturing January 10, 2027, at a 4.7315% interest rate with interest-only monthly payments of $112,045. Listed at $32,500,000, this value-add asset offers flexible floor plans that can be easily divided, with typical floors including workstations, conference rooms, private offices, pantry, and IT facilities. The current annual rental income is $1,005,465, with a projected potential of $3,747,965 when fully leased. Operating expenses total $1,583,723 annually, with real estate taxes of $672,825 (2022/23). The property currently operates at a negative NOI of $(519,849) but has a projected NOI of $2,435,026 when stabilized, presenting significant upside potential for investors seeking an asset below replacement cost with favorable financing, or for potential owner-occupants in a flagship New York City location.
