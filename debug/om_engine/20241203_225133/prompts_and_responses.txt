EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Lee & Associates NYC is exclusively offering for sale the office building located at 20 West 37th Street, New York, NY 10018 (the "Property"). Situated in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the Property is in close proximity to major transportation hubs like Bryant Park, Grand Central Station, and Penn Station, including the premier transit hub of Grand Central Terminal.

The Property features a basement, ground and mezzanine level retail space delivered vacant, along with 11 floors of office space above. The stacking plan reveals four current tenants occupying 32% of the space, with the remaining 68% vacant, presenting an attractive value-add opportunity. It offers an attractive assumable loan originated on 12/8/16 with an outstanding principal of $27,500,000, interest rate of approximately 4.7%, and maturity date of January 10, 2027. The loan has an interest-only monthly payment of $112,045.

The rent roll shows the retail space is currently vacant but projected to achieve $90 per square foot, while the office spaces range from $33.23 to $42 per square foot for in-place rents and $40 per square foot for projected rents on vacant spaces. The in-place net operating income is currently negative at -$519,849, but the projected stabilized net operating income is $2,435,026 after leasing up vacancies.

20 West 37th Street presents a value-add office asset opportunity for an investor to own a mixed-use asset in a prime Manhattan submarket at below replacement cost, with in-place financing at an extremely competitive rate. The significant vacancy allows for immediate renovation and rapid execution of planned capital improvements to achieve stabilized rents and income. The flexible floor plan allows for easily divisible spaces to serve a wide range of tenant needs. Alternatively, it offers a potential user the chance for a New York City flagship location, with immediate vacancy allowing for owner-occupancy.

Key Highlights:
- Attractive assumable financing with $27.5M outstanding principal at a rate sub-5%
- 68% vacant space, allowing for ease of execution for any business plan, including owner-occupancy  
- Projected stabilized net operating income of $2.4M after leasing up vacancies
