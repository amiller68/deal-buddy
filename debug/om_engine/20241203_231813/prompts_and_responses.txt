The information contained in this offering memorandum (“Offering Memorandum”) is proprietary and strictly 
confidential. This Offering Memorandum was prepared by and is the property of Lee & Associates NYC LLC (“L&A”) 
and has been reviewed by the owner (the “Owner”) of the Property. It is furnished solely for the purpose of review 
by a prospective purchaser of the Property and is not to be used for any other purposes or made available to any 
person without the express written consent of the Owner or L&A. By accepting this Offering Memorandum, the party 
in possession hereof agrees to return it to L&A immediately upon request of L&A or Owner. No portion of this Offering 
Memorandum may be copied or otherwise reproduced or disclosed to anyone without the prior written authorization of 
L&A and Owner. Each prospective purchaser and/or broker proceeds at his, her or its own risk.
You have the obligation to keep this Offering Memorandum, and any various papers, documents, legal instruments, 
studies, leases, brochures, computer output, and other materials concerning the Property (all of the aforementioned 
information is collectively referred to as “Evaluation Material”) confidential. Certain Evaluation Materials, including any 
leases, are described in summary form. The summaries do not purport to be complete nor accurate descriptions of the 
full agreements involved, nor do they constitute a legal analysis of such documents. 
The information in this Offering Memorandum has been compiled from sources deemed to be reliable and does not 
purport to be all-inclusive or to contain all of the information which a prospective purchaser may desire. Neither L&A 
nor the Owner makes any representation or warranty whatsoever regarding the accuracy, veracity, or completeness of 
the information provided herein and each of Owner and L&A (and their agents, advisors and representatives) expressly 
disclaim any and all liability for representations or warranties, express or implied, contained in this Offering Memorandum 
or the Evaluation Material or for omissions therefrom. 
Financial projections and information contained herein and in any Evaluation Material, shall not be relied upon, are 
provided for general reference purposes only, and are based on assumptions relating to (and subject to) the general 
economy, market conditions, competition, and other factors beyond control and, therefore, are subject to material 
change, volatility or variation. A prospective purchaser must make its own independent investigations, projections, and 
conclusions regarding the acquisition of the Property. This includes legal, tax, environmental, engineering and other as 
deemed necessary relative to a purchase of the Property. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to 
accept any investment proposal but is merely a solicitation of interest with respect to the investment described herein. 
This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer of securities.
The Owner expressly reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to reject any offer to purchase the Property or to terminate 
any negotiations with any party, at any time, with or without written notice. The Owner and L&A reserve the right 
to negotiate with one or more prospective purchasers at any time. This Offering Memorandum is subject to errors, 
omissions, changes or withdrawal without notice and does not constitute a recommendation, endorsement or advice 
as to the value of the Property by L&A. Only a fully executed real estate purchase and sale agreement, approved by the 
Owner, and executed and delivered to Owner and a prospective purchaser shall bind the Property. In no event shall a 
prospective purchaser have any claims against the Owner or L&A or any of their affiliates, officers, shareholders, owners, 
employees, or agents for any damages, liability, or causes of action relating to this solicitation process or the marketing 
or sale of the Property. 
The terms and conditions set forth above apply to this Offering Memorandum in its entirety.
